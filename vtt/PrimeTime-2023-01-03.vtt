WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
 Alright, so welcome to office hours. It's been a little bit of a gap before the last one we had

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.620
 That's because I was away for the holiday period but I'm back and we're back to regular scheduled broadcasting with the office hours

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.340
 Tuesday at 4 p.m. My time zone which is a Pacific. You can check the office hours wiki page for it in other time zones

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.340
 So this is the AMA

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.940
 Office hours where you can ask questions about Nius and we go through them in the order that is shown in the thread

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.840
 Which I just created. I see some questions in there. So we'll get started on those questions

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.320
 So we have a question here from a rigorous who says how does Nios handle my composition?

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.480
 Actually, I can't answer. I think I know what's going on, but I don't want to be unauthoritative

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.920
 the netcode

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.580
 Code being the sort of stuff that glues together the synchronization and the way that Nia speaks to other people in the session

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.880
 Isn't something I've taken a good look at I'm aware of sort of parts of how it works

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.100
 I'm not aware of

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.820
 How all of that works if you expand your question with additional sort of like elaboration or areas you're looking at

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.680
 I'm about to help further. Otherwise, I'm sorry. I can't answer that one move forward to unnamed cyborg cat who asked

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.180
 What's Nios achieved in 2022?

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.960
 You can check the newest updates channel or the answers channel for stuff that we have done in 22 that is published again

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.480
 If you expand or elaborate a question into additional areas or avenues, it might be easier to answer

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.080
 But that's a really broad question moving forwards to

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.140
 This is second question, which says is there any updates for Nios planned for this year or next year?

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.960
 And there are always updates planned. We just can't do them currently see announcements, etc, etc

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.640
 And with that unfortunately, we're out of questions. So keep them coming. Otherwise, we'll be set here and unimaginable unending

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.560
 tormenting silence

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.200
 Waiting for questions. I do think I could probably take the gap in questions

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.040
 There's an opportunity to wish you the very best for the new year. I had many difficulties typing the word 2023 today

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.880
 I had to put it into the thread. I had to put it into the

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.500
 Various other things as well. So we have another question here from Jack who says how was New Year's?

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.660
 I spent it at Geens's house Geens throws a sort of almost annual tradition now, which is a party his house for New Year's

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.940
 It was great. Saw a lot of Nios people there

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.820
 Met some new faces saw some old faces

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.380
 Lots of fun was had

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.260
 Chikal girl says how is your own personal work on medical insulation thing? It's it's going well

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.740
 There's not really much to say

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.260
 On top of the videos I produce sort of in November December last year

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.840
 That's sort of where we're at right now are doing some additional exploration into sort of what's going on there

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.360
 But to share right now

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.700
 Okay

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.500
 So check a girl says if you're very old you might refer to January's check your area the month we accidentally write the previous year

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.500
 on your checks

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.100
 Checks I am aware that like some

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.100
 businesses and

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.280
 Landlords and my rental places still don't understand direct deposit but like you don't need checks anymore. You just use what's called direct deposit

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.220
 So your money can go straight in your bank and the rent can come straight back out again

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.280
 I've heard many a story about landlords who don't understand direct deposit and they want their like rent in cash

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.080
 No, just like are they filing taxes on your rental? Is it a legal rental?

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.020
 Paying cash. It's a bit weird

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.580
 You should at least get paperwork if you're paying a rent in cash

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.040
 Make sure you get paperwork invoice for rent the fact that it's been received and signed and stuff like that like crazy

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.200
 Sometimes they want checks that's like okay ish

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.200
 But you should encourage them to use direct deposit

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.060
 The way does I have is like if they don't need cash or if they won't accept cash or sorry

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.120
 They won't accept direct deposit which means cash or check then they have to come visit you and you have to talk to them

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.900
 I don't want to talk to my landlord

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.220
 It's not a desire I have if I talk to them it means something is wrong

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.380
 So direct deposit the rent just goes straight to them

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.260
 I don't know when it just does when I see it, you know

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.020
 It's not something I do manually moving forwards to a reverse this question

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.700
 Who says it's possible make a web server in logics in Neos with logics? No

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.500
 logics is a language ish the

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.340
 interacts with the Neos world and the Neos

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.860
 data model and the Neos engine

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.100
 So it's limited in what it can do

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:05.100
 There are some things it can do the sort of exceed the bounds of Neos for example the HTTP or web socket nodes

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.040
 But remember that it is running within a another engine. So you can't do it to you. You can't use it to solve generic tasks

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.180
 It's sort of the equivalent of saying can you make a web server in redstone in Minecraft?

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.460
 Like I hope that helps you sort of picture in your head moving forward to another question abysmal says is there currently a maximum?

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.980
 Maximum of users that can join a session

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.080
 Do you know how many avatars Neos is aiming to support once can expect Neos to be usable for MMO player counts?

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.580
 Um, there isn't a maximum which is enforced by anything that is decision-based

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.460
 so the only maximum would be like technical and so it's probably something close to one of the

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.620
 binary numbers

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.500
 But I wouldn't know which one it was without looking a nose in high as 50

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.240
 I'm pretty sure I can go higher than that. Like there's no there's no real like limit that we have made a decision about

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.000
 As for what we're aiming for we are aiming to make that better to get that number up

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.740
 Particularly to get that number up to sort of you know, be more of sort of VR chat style levels

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.100
 I don't know if we're aiming or able to get it to the MMO player count would need much more culling there pretty

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.980
 Automatic culling I know that the community are great and putting all the culling systems into their world

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.120
 But you shouldn't have to we should have a native solution

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.100
 So once we have that it should make every world able to be called as well as the the cold sessions that you see from

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.420
 The systems that people are making and installing in them and then a reverse also asks is it possible to make auto load?

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.860
 Sort of the problem level of detail is it depends on what you mean? So in games

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.760
 Level of detail is you just sort of like stuff will look less detailed the further away you are from you can sometimes see that

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.520
 Pop in which is where they've done lots slightly incorrectly

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.100
 where you know

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.780
 You'll sort of like go over the threshold of a doorway or something and the contents of the room inside will turn from sort of shit

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.660
 Tier to like amazing tier graphics. That's an example of log being done incorrectly to do it in a way where it's not noticeable

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.420
 You can absolutely do some mod systems there, but the limitation is

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.180
 that the LODs are

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:08.140
 Always loaded in so for example if you're a high poly one or a low poly one, that's still loaded into the world

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:13.020
 You're just swapping between them for rendering. So while you do maybe get a little hit for rendering which is better

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.440
 You'll lose that on the sort of model being in memory in the games thing

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.160
 They you know, they try and load only the details that you need

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.380
 So if you never visit an area, they don't load the high poly version of that area for example

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:31.560
 There is a gap issue for more LOD related stuff. Yeah, the inbuilt LOD one is like a little you have a lot component

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.540
 I just it's weird. So we have another question here from Marubus who says

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.760
 How do I measure distance from a player to an object in logics?

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.180
 so the easiest way to do that would be to

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.040
 Grab a slot reference to both the player and a slot reference to the object

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.120
 Make sure they're both in global by using the global transform node

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:53.840
 That's just easier and then plug both of their positions the global position of the player and the level position of the object

00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:00.080
 Into the distance node which exists in an operators or math at large that will calculate you the distance

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.080
 We're gonna do it automatically. There are various things

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.600
 Use a distance value driver

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:10.680
 And stuff like that. They'll handle the whole like global cool mess for you, but that's how you do it

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:16.860
 It's just a mathematical thing the distance between two objects is just the difference in their position and then you

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.200
 normalize everything and the distance node also

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:26.420
 Magnitude because it's a three-dimensional thingy. Jbot says question similar to the surgical visual planning

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.720
 Where are there other projects for Neos focused on building digital workspaces be it for dialing manufacturing?

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.280
 Not that I'm aware of but probably I mean there's like God knows what going on. Not that I'm aware of

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.880
 Moving on to Rigibus who says can Neos interface with a drawing tablet?

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.440
 Depends on what you mean

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:48.300
 You can put the Neos screen on a drawing tablet and then the pen will work with it

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.720
 As in when you push if it's like, you know, if operates as a mouse like where you put the pen will push

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.680
 We do not interface with the drawing tablet sort of pressure sensors

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:04.360
 Smoothness angle sensors or anything like that. It would literally just be a click touch screen like one of those really bad touch screens

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.400
 You know like an airport touch screen. Yeah, one of those I was on a lot of planes over the holidays and

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:14.640
 In-flight entertainment systems god damn their touch screens are bad. Specs are answering their question though. I think

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:21.200
 Wraith, what ID do you use these days? I am on a mixture of Visual Studio code for anything that is not like

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:29.800
 Compiling if it needs compiling I should try to go to Visual Studio hate to be boring, but I need stuff to just work and

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.740
 Once it works, I don't really have like much inkling to change it

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:39.980
 So getting Neos compiling in Visual Studio was like a two-week effort and now it works. I'm like cool

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.260
 Let's not break. Rigibus says how smooth does

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.780
 Neos run on the Raspberry Pi 3? I don't know. I don't own a Raspberry Pi 3

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.960
 I own a Raspberry Pi 4, a Raspberry Pi 0 and a Raspberry Pi 2 so I don't know. I skipped the 3

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.500
 You're more than welcome to try that is what's called an empirical question

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:01.100
 Rampa says that it's not boring with the community vs license being pretty good. It does it is good

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:08.200
 What I meant by that is like some people expect on a cool tools or better workflows, etc

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.540
 I'm like so ask would you know what causes the loading indicator for a world to stay open and never finish?

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.920
 I don't know. There's a bug open for it though. Alright, so we have

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.440
 another question here from Rigibus who says

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:24.760
 How does Neos multiplayer architecture work? Is the Neos backend just a big database with reference to IP addresses that contain the public instances?

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:31.340
 Again, your question is it's more focused. Got that. It's more focused, but it's still unfocused

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.180
 So there are two parts of the multiplayer architecture

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:39.720
 So there's the stuff where we communicate to the cloud and then there's the stuff where we communicate to the session host

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.440
 And those two different things they do overlap in some cases, but those are two different

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.900
 So again, it depends what you mean based on the second part of your question, though

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.480
 I'll assume we're talking about session listing in that case

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:57.760
 Session listing is just a big database with a reference of where to connect there might not be an IP address

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.160
 It might be like some other route or some other thing

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:06.840
 Sometimes it's a bit more complicated than that. But yeah, that's the session list. It's big database keep the questions coming

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.380
 Yeah, the river says how do I switch between sessions and desktop?

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.840
 I know the session list facet thing that requires it in the dashboard has been put up

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.480
 You can't all tab as far as I'm aware

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.060
 Jack said you could troll tab shift look at that on the

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.700
 Troll tab and okay guys make sure to read the basic controls wiki page

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.240
 Which has a lot of sort of shortcuts which aren't documented anywhere and tell you how to use this

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.360
 That's our bad. We'll fix that as soon as we can

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:35.280
 Additionally to that the original way that you are meant to transit between sessions

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.820
 without the facet which I made and without the legacy world switcher is if you go to the

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:48.000
 Active sessions tab of the world browser you'll see the sessions that you're in there at the top and you can select them there and

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.200
 Then click focus world on the pop-up that appears

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.080
 So those are a variety of ways to do it. I thought that that was

00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:02.180
 Potentially confusing and not like a short path. That's why I made that facet. There's lots of praise for the world's are invested

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:07.240
 That's the one I made I like I just got annoyed and I solved a problem and everyone else was like I'm annoyed by that

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:13.080
 Too and they just like everyone installed it. It was great. Yeah, we are investigating making it into some default facet

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:20.640
 Puddle Nexus world so Lex is talking about a world I made where there's an active sessions ball for each world

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.700
 Yeah, I just I hacked the world browser apart to make that work

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:31.840
 So that world is technically a world browser where I've convinced it not to make UIX stuff

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.360
 I never intended it for it to work or people to enjoy going there

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.480
 It's just sort of like this is asking what portals are and how they work since some people mess with them

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.800
 I can understand what they did. How do you mean?

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:49.740
 Camera portals or well, let's make a second screen arampa. That's why I did camera portals. Okay, so camera portals are

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.980
 Somewhat similar to and it's kind of like good to view them like this

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:59.240
 Having another headset in the world that you can sort of look through

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:05.080
 So what it does is it makes a camera like a traditional camera, but it renders it stereoscopically

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.360
 so

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:12.600
 The you know, the left eye is different from the right eye and it does that according to your headset your your rendering, etc

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.160
 But only when you're looking at that camera portals like rendering pain

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:22.080
 So it's like having like another headset camera, you know with the two left eye right anything in the world

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.040
 That's really all it is. It's just like a rendering trick

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:30.060
 We get sort of a stereoscopic camera another word for it literally would be stereoscopic camera

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.000
 the bit that makes it cool and more portal like though is the ability to move the

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.400
 Camera location separately from the rendering location, which of course you can technically do have a camera as well

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.400
 It's just really confusingly named

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.760
 But it is like a portal to another part of the world or another

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.240
 Area, there's really not much to them though. You just like create a new object portal there

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.640
 You're done. You can make them different shapes different sizes. They don't need to be square

00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.640
 You put them on like rings and stuff. That's always cool. That's how the portal guns usually work. The camera says

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.640
 What kind of optimizations can I do for big worlds?

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:08.120
 For big worlds, you need to make sure that you are culling so grab one of the culling systems already exists or make your own

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:13.160
 Not only culling objects, but also culling players. Make sure that's happening

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:19.620
 You need to balance your sounds so that you don't have more than 32 sounds running or like some of them will like not work

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:25.320
 You can make sure your assets are optimized effectively. For example, I once had to help a

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:31.860
 Game design student who was trying to do a project at university and their unity project wouldn't compile

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:37.360
 And I found out that they had a million trees in their scene because they wanted a forest and so they put a million

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.480
 individual trees in their scene and

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.600
 No

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.720
 That's not how you should do it

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:50.000
 So do keep an eye on that. The way you do it is you should have up close some trees

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:56.000
 As you go further and further away, you should transition to lower and lower poly trees and at a certain point

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.980
 Just a picture of trees and that's what you do. Other than that. It's like the contents low

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:08.340
 You know, do you need 8k textures on this piece of concrete? Probably not. Everything on the dash can be resized. Everything

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.440
 So the world browser itself, so I'm jumping around a little bit. There's comments about the world browser going on

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.520
 The world browser is composed of essentially four facets

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.400
 There's the filter list on the left which has you like everything, active sessions, features, etc

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.160
 There's the the grid in the middle

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.800
 which is all the sessions and then there is the search bar at the top middle and the

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:34.720
 pagination bar on the top right. Those are all facets. You can move them around exactly like other facets. As for questions

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.560
 Specs says are there any plans to update the content hub in the future? I would love

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.980
 I kind of love the place and it would be a little sad if it got left in dust in a favour and made it more convenient dashboard UIs

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.480
 I do believe that the content team have plans to update it

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.740
 For anyone who's not aware of what the content hub is, that is the space station

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.560
 satellite space station thingy

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.320
 Which was used in a lot of streams

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.420
 until the twitch house got created and then we

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:06.040
 It's meant to be like a content hub. It's meant to be I guess a little bit like the VRChat home

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:12.760
 You know, there's like you can go discover what's out there. It just has been it was deprioritized for the MTC and you know

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.600
 Busy working on other stuff. So I hope it returns. Ray said that be kind of more of a question for the content team

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.400
 Yeah, if the content team had an office hours, maybe that would be cool

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.700
 I mean you can ask them questions at workshop Wednesday. That's usually where I catch them

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:29.440
 I can catch them whenever I want, but you know, if you're a user you want to ask the content team questions

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.800
 Try the workshop Wednesday stream. Yeah, I understand that workshop Wednesday is on hiatus

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.800
 That's usually where I can. Moving on to Rigibus' question when importing assets from blender

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:42.200
 Is there any don't @ team members at me? If you need to @ team member at me, I can take it

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.240
 I'm weird like that. I can like just process notifications quite well

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.320
 Is there any kind of thing I need to do in a blender project to make it work better?

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.960
 I've tried importing some models from blender, but the scale would always be wrong

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:58.540
 Scale is one which is actually kind of easy to do. So if I default blender scale is in meters

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:03.000
 So when you import a model from blender or any other source that you know has been in blender

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 Usually what you say and what I say in my tutorials is I go 3d model and then auto size, right?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.960
 I always say select auto size if you know, it came from blender and you know that blender was using meters for it

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.700
 It's like scene units like this the units of the file

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:21.560
 Select meters rather than auto scale and then it will come in at the exact scale

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:26.560
 Which it was in in blender. If you export to FBX or other things then you'll have oddities generally

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:32.900
 I'm trying to sort of advise going away from FBX these days head was GLTF if you need to do avatars and animations and stuff

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:37.660
 Blender works well as well. Blender it'll just turn into an FBX and a GL whatever

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.380
 Try it though. Um, I will be making a tutorial on at some point

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:47.860
 until then go into blender make a one meter by one meter cube in blender import it into

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:54.540
 Neos until you get a one meter by one meter cube in Neos you can use the meter tip for that

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:58.420
 And that will allow you to sort of see what size it is

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:01.780
 And then you'll know what works and the reason why I'm telling you to do it

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.600
 Even though I will make a tutorial at some point is it'll give you a feel for what's going on

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.300
 Like if you import a one meter by one meter cube and it comes in a hundred meters, you know

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.440
 Oh, I understand what's happening here Neos or blender or something in the middle here for some reason

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:18.460
 It's making everything a hundred times bigger like get a feel for your workflow spend time on your workflow as well

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:22.260
 I know sometimes the temptation is like well if I do three hours work on each model

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.900
 Then I don't have to work on the workflow or you can just work on the workflow and then you don't need to spend that

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.340
 time every time

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:31.120
 It was it for the blender question. If you have any other blender issues you add more questions

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:38.780
 Arukabha says it's possible to make a mod to lower the resolution of all active mirrors in Neos

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:42.860
 It is please ask the modding community for that on the mod you've scored. Just a quick reminder here

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:47.580
 Because people are talking about map makers not adding, you know, things like mirror options stuff like that

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.240
 You go to Neos Essentials Mirrors

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:54.120
 There is a wide array of mirrors the ones to the right usually have those menus and the ones to the left don't

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.380
 So you pick one on the right and then you can have automatic

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.900
 mirror resolution modifiers

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:04.520
 Additionally, remember that we have the community sort of standards thing that is able to happen

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:10.560
 We were able to do it with the colors for music that was done. Most people use the same

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:17.160
 Variables for that these days your avatar just works someone could write up a standard for

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.120
 cloud variables and stuff for

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.520
 resolution right and then it could be hey, I am telling you the

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.880
 cloud variable

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:27.840
 resolution

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:33.160
 Scale on off state of mirrors in the world and then you can say you could do that

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:38.580
 Perfectly, you probably need to do that via group and go to like I don't know G standards or something

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:44.660
 I don't know whatever but like you could do it is within your power to do it. Should we Neos maybe have some standard

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:49.160
 Cloud variables that you can hook into probably but we don't currently

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:55.200
 Where are we? Fuzzy ask is there a page about the non standard standard stuff? Yeah, I mean

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.880
 It's a complete mess but like

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:03.800
 I've been meaning to tidy up if I tidy up it starts looking like official and I don't want to be official because it's not

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.160
 official

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:11.560
 There's some stuff there that has just got it's mostly audio and like audio color stuff. So alright got some more questions

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.720
 Does these supports playing SVG files?

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.400
 Don't remember gonna say no

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.480
 Make an issue on the gap if you'd like to see that

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:27.640
 This also asks how variables work in logics again that really does depend on the avenue that you're after so, please

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.640
 Try a lab ring on the questions. See if you can make it any sort of more

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.120
 Detailed and be able to answer that one. Otherwise, it's a bit sort of too vague

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:41.940
 You know that could be how do variables synchronize which is a 20 minute explanation or how do you write a variable?

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.380
 Which is like a 30 second explanation like it you expand your question

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:49.000
 I can I can help you out better how to read and write the variables. Ah, yeah. Okay. There we go

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.960
 Um, so there's there's various ways to do that and it depends on the type of variable that you're using the thing

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.320
 that you need to remember is

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:02.640
 The most fields like every time for example, every time we see a number that's probably an int or a float field

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.460
 Sometimes it's a double and some other weird ones. Don't worry about it

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:11.840
 But it's usually a float or an integer and that is a variable and you can write to it if it's part of a component

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.840
 You'll need to use the logic interface card

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:20.760
 If it's in logics, then you can use the nodes for that those are in variable storage value register

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:25.720
 And then into a float whatever type you want there and then you can use the right note to write to those

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.080
 But you can also use the right note to write to logic interface cards

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.920
 They're all variables and you can all write to them

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:37.340
 If that didn't make sense, then I would suggest taking a look at the introduction to logics. There's a very good video by a business

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.340
 Basement nerd. Sorry. There is also one by

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:46.560
 Business law is a little bit older now so you try both of those triple yeah like pretty much every single time you see a text

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.480
 Box of some kind where you can type in a number or a letter or a type or anything like that

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:55.020
 It's a variable in those various ways to do. Jackal asks if you import vector files. Does anyone understand what it is?

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:59.860
 No, we don't. With that we are at half past so I'm gonna go ahead and say

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:04.280
 777Faku if you have a question, please continue typing it. Rigibus if you have a question continue typing it

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.960
 But the only two additional questions I take for this office

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:15.260
 I'll just make noises. Rigibus says how does the newest database I had the database corrupted yesterday and I was wondering how Neos

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:20.320
 Stores something like a SQLite database. It is a SQLite database. I believe it's NoSQLite

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:26.520
 I don't remember. The point being is that there is a local database lightdb. That's the one. It's a NoSQL

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.080
 SQLite style thingy

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:34.620
 It's basically a file and the file is a database that can be queried by Neos and it

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.960
 And what we do is we say hey database, where is

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.720
 Rafe's face text?

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:47.840
 Where is the texture for Rafe's face and the database goes it is here and that here that I'm talking about is usually a file path

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.280
 On your computer and then it picks up from the computer and goes here you go

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.520
 I'm now rendering Rafe's face and we don't need to redownload it from the internet because we had it stored locally in the cache

00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:02.980
 When the database corrupts it means that file that light database has corrupted and we can't read from it

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:07.800
 And therefore we don't know what's going on. You know, we can't figure out where those files are

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.320
 And that's what happens when it gets corrupt

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:16.340
 That's why we need to repair when we repair it we switch from sort of interrogating as a database. We switch to interrogating it as

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:23.260
 A file that has a problem we fix that problem if we can and then we go back to interrogating as a database

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:28.800
 It is time. I will allow a reverse expanded question because it is related to the previous one

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:34.080
 And I said I would allow some of the vacuus stuff. So I'll read that even though I haven't I don't know

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.940
 I don't think it's a question. I don't see a question mark at least I'll read in just a second

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:42.480
 Um, so they say how does neo store the local cache? Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. I understand. Thank you

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:47.520
 How does neo store the local cache? The local cache is stored as a bunch of you can go just look at them

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:54.940
 There are much of files. They are sort of encrypted, but it's not like encrypting encryption that would be used for anything security related

00:22:54.940 --> 00:23:01.640
 It's it's more sort of partially organizational partially encryption. The light database itself is also encrypted

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.480
 But again, it's not military-grade encryption

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:09.040
 Just a sideline by the way, if you see a VPN advert that's talking about military-grade encryption

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:15.760
 Yeah, your browser already uses it don't buy a VPN if you just want military-grade encryption. Your browser already does it. Anyway

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:22.320
 Point being there is a little bit of encryption involved, but it's not strong. It's not designed to be strong. As for how it stores

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:27.080
 It's just files on your computer and then 775 who said they had an idea in the back of mind for AI

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:32.400
 Integrations for example having a fairy guy that can listen in on command and help out with things like logics and other radio functions

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.780
 Do it I would love it

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.540
 Lots of people talking about getting documentation into games

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:43.500
 And into news being quite interest and stuff like that is one way that it could be done

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:48.180
 We're not quite sure how we're going to do it. But when we do do that, we'll see what's going on

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:54.860
 I'd love it if there was a way to click on a logics node and it popped up the information about it, videos, pictures, guides, etc

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:59.300
 You could even directly like spawn examples of how to use it in the world all sorts of cool stuff like that

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:03.820
 I'll come up with some. With that I believe we're at the end of office hours. I'll go ahead and leave off here and

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:06.140
 I will speak to you later. Bye bye
