0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:04.000
Welcome to Office Hours, my name is ProbablePrime, if you have any questions please drop them

2
0:00:04.000 --> 0:00:08.080
in the Office Hours text chat that is two above the one that you're currently in and

3
0:00:08.080 --> 0:00:09.760
I'll get to the order that they arrive.

4
0:00:09.760 --> 0:00:15.320
If there are no questions we are going to sit here on the precipice of doom with no

5
0:00:15.320 --> 0:00:17.960
noise or sound at all.

6
0:00:17.960 --> 0:00:20.240
The precipice of doom of silence.

7
0:00:20.240 --> 0:00:25.320
So just get those questions in or we have to sit here, you'll slowly go mad at the lack

8
0:00:25.320 --> 0:00:26.320
of sound.

9
0:00:26.320 --> 0:00:30.720
So we have our first question here from Lex which says, what's a good way to optimize

10
0:00:30.720 --> 0:00:33.720
avatars for network traffic, are you making sure that only necessary things are being

11
0:00:33.720 --> 0:00:37.280
sent over the network to make sure the host doesn't get overloaded with data?

12
0:00:37.280 --> 0:00:41.280
That really does depend on the type of avatar, I see a lot of people that do like preemptive

13
0:00:41.280 --> 0:00:45.920
optimization for things that don't make sense to be optimized.

14
0:00:45.920 --> 0:00:49.560
There are like cases where you might want to do it for like artistic reasons, for example

15
0:00:49.560 --> 0:00:54.680
the anylander people will make their own IK, make their own sort of bones and rigging systems

16
0:00:54.680 --> 0:00:56.600
because of artistic reasons.

17
0:00:56.600 --> 0:00:59.960
They like making everything inside game without stepping outside of games.

18
0:00:59.960 --> 0:01:02.740
So they get that functionality.

19
0:01:02.740 --> 0:01:06.900
But I've seen some people who make their own IK because they're like, well, the IK is bad,

20
0:01:06.900 --> 0:01:08.540
it's laggy and I want to avoid it.

21
0:01:08.540 --> 0:01:12.660
That's an example of like optimization that's not needed.

22
0:01:12.660 --> 0:01:19.000
If there's a problem with IK, we'll fix it eventually, we'll optimize it.

23
0:01:19.000 --> 0:01:25.240
There's a good parallel to be placed here on browser stuff and JavaScript, I'm quite

24
0:01:25.240 --> 0:01:26.840
opinionated here.

25
0:01:26.840 --> 0:01:31.600
So there's a bunch of frontend libraries that are designed to just put HTML on the page

26
0:01:31.600 --> 0:01:33.160
and make it interactive.

27
0:01:33.160 --> 0:01:37.840
It's the stuff that powers TweetDeck, like Twitter, whatever website you use, it uses

28
0:01:37.840 --> 0:01:39.460
JavaScript these days.

29
0:01:39.460 --> 0:01:43.840
And there's a lot of cases where developers of JavaScript think they know better than

30
0:01:43.840 --> 0:01:47.400
the browser manufacturers and they'll write their own mechanisms for doing various things

31
0:01:47.400 --> 0:01:51.680
and then the browser people catch up and they're like, hey, if you use our method, it's so

32
0:01:51.680 --> 0:01:52.680
much faster.

33
0:01:52.680 --> 0:01:58.100
So a good example here would be React, which has what's called a virtual sort of HTML virtual

34
0:01:58.100 --> 0:02:00.640
layer where stuff gets copied around.

35
0:02:00.640 --> 0:02:05.780
And that was super fast and is still quite fast, but emerging standard in most browsers

36
0:02:05.780 --> 0:02:11.840
is now a native virtual HTML that makes stuff a lot faster than even React.

37
0:02:11.840 --> 0:02:17.000
But it's going to take years for people to use that because there's inertia from using

38
0:02:17.000 --> 0:02:18.000
the old stuff.

39
0:02:18.000 --> 0:02:20.000
So again, it's a good example.

40
0:02:20.000 --> 0:02:25.480
We know in some cases, we know better than you about our ability to optimize it.

41
0:02:25.480 --> 0:02:31.040
And when we optimize it, if you don't put anything hacky in place, then you get those

42
0:02:31.040 --> 0:02:32.900
optimizations for free.

43
0:02:32.900 --> 0:02:38.040
As a more sort of neo-centric example, if the React stuff blew over your head, let's

44
0:02:38.040 --> 0:02:41.840
say there's one node that you're using quite a lot, using it in every single logics chain

45
0:02:41.840 --> 0:02:46.000
you ever do, and it has a known issue with lag.

46
0:02:46.000 --> 0:02:50.760
You could, for example, avoid that node, or you could open up a bug report, and we could

47
0:02:50.760 --> 0:02:54.960
look at that bug and fix that node, and then every single use of that node would benefit

48
0:02:54.960 --> 0:02:56.360
from the optimization.

49
0:02:56.360 --> 0:03:01.400
If every single user avoided that node because it wasn't optimized, there would be no performance

50
0:03:01.400 --> 0:03:03.240
gain from us making that change.

51
0:03:03.240 --> 0:03:04.240
So keep that in mind.

52
0:03:04.240 --> 0:03:08.760
With that out of the way, once you're away from stuff that is just standard, so if you

53
0:03:08.760 --> 0:03:12.400
want your IK, your avatar to have IK, use IK, user IK systems.

54
0:03:12.400 --> 0:03:17.480
If you want your avatar to have blend shapes, use those.

55
0:03:17.480 --> 0:03:22.080
For reasons other than network traffic, the best practice right now is to actually slice

56
0:03:22.080 --> 0:03:23.080
your head off.

57
0:03:23.080 --> 0:03:24.080
This is kind of grim.

58
0:03:24.080 --> 0:03:28.240
Slice your head off and make sure your blend shapes are only on your head and not on the

59
0:03:28.240 --> 0:03:29.240
rest of your body.

60
0:03:29.240 --> 0:03:33.040
Now, of course, there are body modification blend shapes, like sizing, et cetera.

61
0:03:33.040 --> 0:03:34.040
Those should only be on the body.

62
0:03:34.040 --> 0:03:41.620
The point being is only put the blend shapes where they need to be and split the meshes

63
0:03:41.620 --> 0:03:46.880
such that the data is not copied between those two places, and that's better for performance

64
0:03:46.880 --> 0:03:49.100
in other reasons but not network traffic.

65
0:03:49.100 --> 0:03:54.360
Beyond those two things, which are literally nothing to do with the question really, avoid

66
0:03:54.360 --> 0:03:55.360
writes where you can.

67
0:03:55.360 --> 0:04:00.100
I see a lot of people doing animations or like reciprocal motion based on sort of writes

68
0:04:00.100 --> 0:04:01.100
or Boolean matches.

69
0:04:01.100 --> 0:04:04.520
For example, they might have a tail wag and they're using a Boolean match to do the tail

70
0:04:04.520 --> 0:04:05.520
wag, right?

71
0:04:05.520 --> 0:04:09.740
So they latch the latch on, it goes to true, and the tail swings to the right.

72
0:04:09.740 --> 0:04:13.080
Then the latch off, and the tail swings to the left.

73
0:04:13.080 --> 0:04:16.860
And what you're having there is you're just turning a Boolean match on and off for literally

74
0:04:16.860 --> 0:04:18.260
no reason.

75
0:04:18.260 --> 0:04:21.640
You can use a drive for that, and that would be a lot more performant and a lot less network

76
0:04:21.640 --> 0:04:22.640
traffic.

77
0:04:22.640 --> 0:04:23.640
Just use a sine wave.

78
0:04:23.640 --> 0:04:24.640
That's what a sine wave is.

79
0:04:24.640 --> 0:04:29.840
A sine wave is essentially on a smooth level, a Boolean match turning on and off.

80
0:04:29.840 --> 0:04:30.840
Just mathematics.

81
0:04:30.840 --> 0:04:32.960
So keep that in mind.

82
0:04:32.960 --> 0:04:35.740
And then limit what's on your avatar as well.

83
0:04:35.740 --> 0:04:39.080
If you don't use it every session, you don't need it.

84
0:04:39.080 --> 0:04:43.360
So you know, don't parent a gun to your avatar, because I can guarantee you only shoot that

85
0:04:43.360 --> 0:04:46.320
gun like once a day, maybe.

86
0:04:46.320 --> 0:04:49.180
Sometimes if you parent it to your avatar, you'll find excuses to use it, and it's not

87
0:04:49.180 --> 0:04:52.720
very polite to just walk into every session and be like, oh yeah, the gun on my avatar,

88
0:04:52.720 --> 0:04:55.000
which I need to justify having, I'll shoot everyone.

89
0:04:55.000 --> 0:04:58.520
No, just don't put the gun on your avatar.

90
0:04:58.520 --> 0:05:01.060
Same thing goes with like multi-tools and stuff like that.

91
0:05:01.060 --> 0:05:05.160
If you don't use it, don't put it on your avatar, and before you won't have that.

92
0:05:05.160 --> 0:05:09.040
Then beyond that, just make sure you're using as many drives as possible.

93
0:05:09.040 --> 0:05:12.200
Writes might sound good, repeated writes might sound good, but writes are sort of like a

94
0:05:12.200 --> 0:05:14.440
network synchronization things.

95
0:05:14.440 --> 0:05:20.360
Yeah, the blend shape thing is like, it's just like really, in some cases, like annoying.

96
0:05:20.360 --> 0:05:25.680
It's like there are like defined ways to handle them, but a lot of times, either the defined

97
0:05:25.680 --> 0:05:31.880
ways to handle them right now are kind of difficult to do, or rely on a sort of culture

98
0:05:31.880 --> 0:05:34.160
change in avatar basemakers.

99
0:05:34.160 --> 0:05:37.600
For example, the culture with avatar basemakers right now is to add as many blend shapes as

100
0:05:37.600 --> 0:05:39.640
possible, because that actually drives their sales up.

101
0:05:39.640 --> 0:05:42.640
If they can, you know, especially the body modification blend shapes, if there's like

102
0:05:42.640 --> 0:05:46.600
five different body types and blend shapes change all of those, beautiful, that's a lot

103
0:05:46.600 --> 0:05:48.160
of money for those avatar makers.

104
0:05:48.160 --> 0:05:51.360
If there's a lot of expression blend shapes, again, that's going to drive sales up because

105
0:05:51.360 --> 0:05:53.000
they can make cute faces, etc.

106
0:05:53.000 --> 0:05:58.000
But what that doesn't do is it doesn't provide bases into the community that have optimization

107
0:05:58.000 --> 0:05:59.000
in mind.

108
0:05:59.000 --> 0:06:04.520
If they started just, you know, guillotining the head off properly, there'd be performant

109
0:06:04.520 --> 0:06:05.520
there.

110
0:06:05.520 --> 0:06:10.480
If they, I don't know, if they had something in Unity Blender, or even if we had something

111
0:06:10.480 --> 0:06:14.600
inside of a Neos that made it, baking the blend shapes and putting those around would

112
0:06:14.600 --> 0:06:16.200
be a lot better.

113
0:06:16.200 --> 0:06:19.480
You can do it now, and I do recommend you do it, but some people are just like, it's

114
0:06:19.480 --> 0:06:22.600
too complicated, or I don't want to do it, or I don't understand how to do it.

115
0:06:22.600 --> 0:06:25.040
We could make a better system for that.

116
0:06:25.040 --> 0:06:30.660
I always imagine, like, you know, in Star Trek, where medicine, you know, in Star Trek,

117
0:06:30.660 --> 0:06:32.880
some guys might not notice I trick it.

118
0:06:32.880 --> 0:06:37.840
In Star Trek, of course, because it's a sci-fi, so in the future, I'm always sort of fascinated

119
0:06:37.840 --> 0:06:38.840
by the medical episodes.

120
0:06:38.840 --> 0:06:42.000
You know, someone walks into the doctor, it always seems like much better than the healthcare

121
0:06:42.000 --> 0:06:43.940
system in any country I've ever been in, right?

122
0:06:43.940 --> 0:06:48.120
You just walk into, like here, in reality, you walk into the doctor, and they just got

123
0:06:48.120 --> 0:06:49.460
to guess what's wrong with you.

124
0:06:49.460 --> 0:06:53.040
But in Star Trek, you walk into the doctor, they beep you of a scanner, or then they inject

125
0:06:53.040 --> 0:06:55.840
you of one injection, and then you're done, and you can leave.

126
0:06:55.840 --> 0:06:59.240
Like that's how our tooling should be for avatars, right?

127
0:06:59.240 --> 0:07:02.840
You get out a tool, or you get out a UI, you stick the avatar in it, and you're like, I'll

128
0:07:02.840 --> 0:07:04.880
want to optimize it, and we'll just do everything for you.

129
0:07:04.880 --> 0:07:09.360
We'll find out where the head is, we'll guillotine it, we'll separate those things, we'll bake

130
0:07:09.360 --> 0:07:13.440
burn chips that you aren't using, and then we'll provide you with the optimized version.

131
0:07:13.440 --> 0:07:16.940
You can just save that to your inventory, and that way, you've got an optimized one

132
0:07:16.940 --> 0:07:18.560
and an editing one.

133
0:07:18.560 --> 0:07:20.680
Blender and Unity should also be doing some of that.

134
0:07:20.680 --> 0:07:22.720
I know that VRChat actually does do some of that.

135
0:07:22.720 --> 0:07:26.080
When you upload an avatar, you'll see things like preparing your avatar for upload.

136
0:07:26.080 --> 0:07:30.160
That does do some sort of optimizations and changes to the avatar when it's uploaded.

137
0:07:30.160 --> 0:07:33.320
People just don't notice that, of course, because they can't sort of investigate the

138
0:07:33.320 --> 0:07:34.320
intermediary stage.

139
0:07:34.320 --> 0:07:38.880
The intermediary stage goes straight to VRChat, and so you don't see what's happening there.

140
0:07:38.880 --> 0:07:41.800
But I do know that they do some stuff to sort of adjust things.

141
0:07:41.800 --> 0:07:44.620
To answer this question about, wait, that's a thing, yeah.

142
0:07:44.620 --> 0:07:45.620
It's called Web Components.

143
0:07:45.620 --> 0:07:47.840
It comes under the sort of generic tree of that.

144
0:07:47.840 --> 0:07:53.040
It's a more native way to do what every front-end library does right now, which is basically

145
0:07:53.040 --> 0:08:01.160
like instead of having to write code and JavaScript and stuff to do like, oh, custom element here,

146
0:08:01.160 --> 0:08:07.740
like cheese fountain might be a custom element in HTML, you can just do it using standard

147
0:08:07.740 --> 0:08:13.160
stuff that's built into the browser, and it's faster because it runs faster because it's

148
0:08:13.160 --> 0:08:14.160
in the browser.

149
0:08:14.160 --> 0:08:15.160
It's not JavaScript.

150
0:08:15.160 --> 0:08:18.320
But it's taking a while for people to catch up to it.

151
0:08:18.320 --> 0:08:19.320
Moving on.

152
0:08:19.320 --> 0:08:23.720
Jonathan has a question, will there be any way in the future to pull your own avatars

153
0:08:23.720 --> 0:08:24.720
out of Neos?

154
0:08:24.720 --> 0:08:27.640
Like if you worked on your avatar at some point in the future, you want to edit a few

155
0:08:27.640 --> 0:08:31.160
things on it in Blender, but don't want to go back through the process of redoing everything

156
0:08:31.160 --> 0:08:33.080
on a new version of your avatar.

157
0:08:33.080 --> 0:08:34.640
Yes and no.

158
0:08:34.640 --> 0:08:39.480
When your avatar is imported into Neos, it is changed through a couple of mechanisms.

159
0:08:39.480 --> 0:08:43.000
First of all, it goes from a sort of FBX or whatever you import it as, whatever file type.

160
0:08:43.000 --> 0:08:51.400
It goes from there to like ass importers internal format, and then into Neos's internal format.

161
0:08:51.400 --> 0:08:54.600
And going backwards from that is kind of difficult.

162
0:08:54.600 --> 0:08:56.400
And so that's why that doesn't work right now.

163
0:08:56.400 --> 0:08:58.920
That's why exporting avatars does not work right now.

164
0:08:58.920 --> 0:09:02.120
There are stuff that we can do there to make that a lot easier.

165
0:09:02.120 --> 0:09:05.800
What I would actually think would be a better move there, though, would be to make it more

166
0:09:05.800 --> 0:09:10.040
seamless for you to reimport the avatar and just sort of like shoot it across onto the

167
0:09:10.040 --> 0:09:11.140
current avatar.

168
0:09:11.140 --> 0:09:14.840
You can already do that, but it does have limitations.

169
0:09:14.840 --> 0:09:18.880
If you don't change blend shapes, you just change weights or you just adjust blend shapes.

170
0:09:18.880 --> 0:09:21.920
So no added blend shapes, no added bones.

171
0:09:21.920 --> 0:09:27.040
You can just update the mesh reference on your avatar and it will work.

172
0:09:27.040 --> 0:09:30.400
If you add blend shapes or add bones, it can not work.

173
0:09:30.400 --> 0:09:33.480
I should probably like document that a little bit because like some people don't realize

174
0:09:33.480 --> 0:09:34.480
that happens.

175
0:09:34.480 --> 0:09:37.400
But yeah, if you don't add any bones, you don't have any blend shapes, you just edit

176
0:09:37.400 --> 0:09:39.640
stuff in those existing constraints.

177
0:09:39.640 --> 0:09:41.600
Just replace the mesh reference.

178
0:09:41.600 --> 0:09:42.600
Perfectly easy.

179
0:09:42.600 --> 0:09:43.600
You don't need to do anything.

180
0:09:43.600 --> 0:09:45.200
I don't have all the time for UV editing.

181
0:09:45.200 --> 0:09:51.160
UV editing is quite stable and usually UV editing doesn't touch the bones or blend shapes.

182
0:09:51.160 --> 0:09:53.800
You're just adjusting the UVs or adjusting the textures.

183
0:09:53.800 --> 0:09:57.520
You can just drop in a new mesh reference.

184
0:09:57.520 --> 0:09:58.980
I also do it for weights.

185
0:09:58.980 --> 0:10:04.320
Weights also appears to be one that is stable as long as you don't add any bones, for example.

186
0:10:04.320 --> 0:10:08.880
I always have issues with clothing, like clipping where the skin clips through or bits of clothing

187
0:10:08.880 --> 0:10:12.160
clip with each other and so I edit the weight painting a lot and I don't need to recreate

188
0:10:12.160 --> 0:10:13.160
the avatar in that case.

189
0:10:13.160 --> 0:10:15.160
I just update the mesh reference and it works.

190
0:10:15.160 --> 0:10:18.480
But that is because I am not breaking any of those constraints I mentioned.

191
0:10:18.480 --> 0:10:24.200
I also want to get one of those like, you know when you have to do a humanoid unity

192
0:10:24.200 --> 0:10:25.200
and let's see if I can get a picture.

193
0:10:25.200 --> 0:10:26.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

194
0:10:26.200 --> 0:10:27.200
There's this screen.

195
0:10:27.200 --> 0:10:30.420
I want to see if we can get something similar to that inside Unity.

196
0:10:30.420 --> 0:10:34.840
It would only, inside Neos, it would only appear when there's a problem.

197
0:10:34.840 --> 0:10:40.400
Like if we can't automatically do it, we could like open it up or maybe you could edit it

198
0:10:40.400 --> 0:10:41.840
afterwards if there was a problem.

199
0:10:41.840 --> 0:10:43.960
I don't want that to be a step that everyone has to go through.

200
0:10:43.960 --> 0:10:47.480
I want it to be a step that people have to go through if they want to edit stuff or they

201
0:10:47.480 --> 0:10:52.040
want to adjust it or it's coming in wrong and they need to just do it manually.

202
0:10:52.040 --> 0:10:55.240
That would be great because then it would be like, cool, you don't need to worry about

203
0:10:55.240 --> 0:10:56.240
the rig.

204
0:10:56.240 --> 0:10:59.620
We have a lot of people that come in and they say like, hey, what is the rig requirements

205
0:10:59.620 --> 0:11:00.620
for Neos?

206
0:11:00.620 --> 0:11:04.480
And we link them the wiki article I wrote, but then they're like, oh, I've got a remake

207
0:11:04.480 --> 0:11:09.240
my avatar to conform to that rig and I'm like, it's really not like, it's not that much different

208
0:11:09.240 --> 0:11:10.240
to VR chats.

209
0:11:10.240 --> 0:11:11.840
Like it's almost identical to VR chats.

210
0:11:11.840 --> 0:11:17.920
Like, I don't know why you're redoing your rig, so cool, confusing, but there we go.

211
0:11:17.920 --> 0:11:24.040
Moving onwards to more questions, Kip says, do you know a good sound file playlist object

212
0:11:24.040 --> 0:11:25.040
in public folders?

213
0:11:25.040 --> 0:11:26.040
I don't know playlists.

214
0:11:26.040 --> 0:11:31.920
The only playlist one I know is the Polylogix YouTube player that can handle YouTube playlists.

215
0:11:31.920 --> 0:11:38.280
There are a few I have seen that can do like multiple sound files in a list, but I don't

216
0:11:38.280 --> 0:11:39.520
have one to hand.

217
0:11:39.520 --> 0:11:41.480
I'm somewhat sound-adversed.

218
0:11:41.480 --> 0:11:47.520
So he's boiling in here, so I'm going to go ahead and turn on the magical AC.

219
0:11:47.520 --> 0:11:50.280
Yeah, I have a portable AC unit.

220
0:11:50.280 --> 0:11:55.880
It's a big, large, stupid, but it makes the room cold, so I'm happy about that.

221
0:11:55.880 --> 0:11:58.840
It doesn't make the room cold when I have too many doors open, because if I have my

222
0:11:58.840 --> 0:12:02.360
bedroom door and my bathroom door open, it kind of doubles the square footage which it

223
0:12:02.360 --> 0:12:04.320
needs to exact pressure on.

224
0:12:04.320 --> 0:12:07.640
I can never remember if an air conditioner does negative or positive pressure, but it

225
0:12:07.640 --> 0:12:11.440
needs like a complete closed system to work effectively.

226
0:12:11.440 --> 0:12:14.680
So we're going to go close them doors, be right back.

227
0:12:14.680 --> 0:12:17.720
Keep questions coming, I'll get back to them in just a second.

228
0:12:17.720 --> 0:12:21.320
And I'm back with the bedroom and bathroom door closed, we now have a closed pressure

229
0:12:21.320 --> 0:12:24.120
system which has immediately doubled the effect of the air conditioner.

230
0:12:24.120 --> 0:12:28.040
So if your air conditioner isn't working, close those windows, close those doors, get

231
0:12:28.040 --> 0:12:30.560
a draft excluder for your doors as well.

232
0:12:30.560 --> 0:12:35.560
I have a sticky plastic draft excluder that went on my front door, because when my AC

233
0:12:35.560 --> 0:12:39.440
was on, there was this whistling noise, which was effectively cold air I'm paying for, going

234
0:12:39.440 --> 0:12:41.840
out underneath my door, and I'm like, nope!

235
0:12:41.840 --> 0:12:43.960
I'm paying for that air!

236
0:12:43.960 --> 0:12:44.960
Screw you!

237
0:12:44.960 --> 0:12:48.360
With that, we're out of questions, if you have any more questions, please do let us

238
0:12:48.360 --> 0:12:49.360
know.

239
0:12:49.360 --> 0:12:50.360
Please drop those questions in.

240
0:12:50.360 --> 0:12:54.120
If there are no additional questions, then soul crushing silence commences now.

241
0:12:54.120 --> 0:12:59.240
You have the power of the sun in your hands, you can ask any question you want, and you're

242
0:12:59.240 --> 0:13:01.760
choosing to ask a B in silence.

243
0:13:01.760 --> 0:13:02.760
Interesting.

244
0:13:02.760 --> 0:13:06.040
Quick call out by the way, occasionally when colliders come up in office hours, I make

245
0:13:06.040 --> 0:13:11.880
a reference to a good example for using active colliders being mining with a pickaxe.

246
0:13:11.880 --> 0:13:16.460
And I got kind of annoyed that I kept forgetting to make that tutorial, so I spent some time

247
0:13:16.460 --> 0:13:17.960
yesterday and made the tutorial.

248
0:13:17.960 --> 0:13:22.260
It's probably the hardest I've worked on a tutorial in a long time, so I'll just link

249
0:13:22.260 --> 0:13:23.600
it in the office hours chat there.

250
0:13:23.600 --> 0:13:28.520
Here's a 30-minute long tutorial about building a mining system, and that's cool.

251
0:13:28.520 --> 0:13:31.560
It was probably about, like, three hours start to finish.

252
0:13:31.560 --> 0:13:33.480
I was like, I should record this.

253
0:13:33.480 --> 0:13:34.480
I need some assets.

254
0:13:34.480 --> 0:13:35.560
I have found some assets.

255
0:13:35.560 --> 0:13:37.640
I will build the object and make sure it works.

256
0:13:37.640 --> 0:13:38.640
Okay, it works.

257
0:13:38.640 --> 0:13:39.640
Cool.

258
0:13:39.640 --> 0:13:44.560
Now I've got to do, like, a recording of a 30-minute tutorial without many mistakes.

259
0:13:44.560 --> 0:13:45.800
I did it in one take.

260
0:13:45.800 --> 0:13:47.160
I did it in one take.

261
0:13:47.160 --> 0:13:48.520
No editing.

262
0:13:48.520 --> 0:13:52.040
There are a couple, like, oopsie doozles, but it's fine.

263
0:13:52.040 --> 0:13:58.120
The storm says that the CJ group made a system using active colliders.

264
0:13:58.120 --> 0:14:00.120
Yeah, they should have.

265
0:14:00.120 --> 0:14:01.880
Colliders are exactly what you need for that.

266
0:14:01.880 --> 0:14:04.600
The reason behind that is, I mean, I talk about it a little bit in the tutorial as well,

267
0:14:04.600 --> 0:14:08.840
but it's like a problem with, like, sets.

268
0:14:08.840 --> 0:14:11.940
Basically you have a set of miningable objects that you want to be static.

269
0:14:11.940 --> 0:14:15.720
You don't want the mineable objects that are out in the world to be doing anything idly.

270
0:14:15.720 --> 0:14:19.880
If they're doing anything, you've got some wrong stuff there.

271
0:14:19.880 --> 0:14:22.640
They don't need to be doing any maths or living their best life.

272
0:14:22.640 --> 0:14:24.240
They're just inanimate objects.

273
0:14:24.240 --> 0:14:27.540
But then you've got a bunch of people wielding pickaxes that want to be doing stuff.

274
0:14:27.540 --> 0:14:32.440
They want to be attacking the ore, so it makes sense to put the colliders on the stuff, which

275
0:14:32.440 --> 0:14:33.440
is...

276
0:14:33.440 --> 0:14:34.440
There's less of.

277
0:14:34.440 --> 0:14:36.280
There are more ore veins than people.

278
0:14:36.280 --> 0:14:37.280
No business lawyer.

279
0:14:37.280 --> 0:14:42.120
If you wanted to mine trees without punching them, you would need to maybe get an axe tree

280
0:14:42.120 --> 0:14:43.400
chopping thing.

281
0:14:43.400 --> 0:14:48.180
I'm happy to do more RPG-style tutorials.

282
0:14:48.180 --> 0:14:51.480
In that video, I talk about, like, hey, what's next after mining smelting?

283
0:14:51.480 --> 0:14:53.440
We could totally do a smelting tutorial.

284
0:14:53.440 --> 0:14:58.280
That would actually probably be easier, because that would just be, like, hey, you take the

285
0:14:58.280 --> 0:15:02.880
mined ore, you throw it into the furnace, you wait a few seconds logic-wise, and now

286
0:15:02.880 --> 0:15:04.880
it pops like a bar.

287
0:15:04.880 --> 0:15:07.760
Stereotypical mining.

288
0:15:07.760 --> 0:15:11.360
Although it might be interesting to see if we can recreate hydrineer systems.

289
0:15:11.360 --> 0:15:17.560
So in hydrineer, you can drop multiple ore nuggets into a cauldron and then pour it out,

290
0:15:17.560 --> 0:15:20.960
and that will get you a higher bar, like a higher purity bar.

291
0:15:20.960 --> 0:15:24.320
Which works out fine, until you realize that you've been, you know, playing the game a

292
0:15:24.320 --> 0:15:30.680
long time, and that your one gold bar has, like, three million gold worth of gold inside

293
0:15:30.680 --> 0:15:31.680
it.

294
0:15:31.680 --> 0:15:36.960
Because it's just, like, cool, that cauldron will just keep adding weight and quality until

295
0:15:36.960 --> 0:15:38.200
you stop it.

296
0:15:38.200 --> 0:15:39.800
So linker says health system.

297
0:15:39.800 --> 0:15:41.520
Yeah, I keep thinking about that one.

298
0:15:41.520 --> 0:15:45.200
It's difficult to do, and the reason behind that one is that there are so many health

299
0:15:45.200 --> 0:15:47.800
systems that exist out there already.

300
0:15:47.800 --> 0:15:52.560
There are a couple that sort of communicate between multiple games as well, they've established

301
0:15:52.560 --> 0:15:53.560
a couple of standards.

302
0:15:53.560 --> 0:15:57.840
In a way, there's a standard one of the building groups uses, and I would think there's a standard

303
0:15:57.840 --> 0:16:00.200
which the Japanese community uses as well.

304
0:16:00.200 --> 0:16:02.320
And so I would hate to introduce another standard.

305
0:16:02.320 --> 0:16:08.480
But if I make it deliberately a little bit crunchy and a little bit basic, then that

306
0:16:08.480 --> 0:16:09.480
might work.

307
0:16:09.480 --> 0:16:10.880
That's what I did for the mining system as well.

308
0:16:10.880 --> 0:16:15.680
There's no, like, durability or anything like that, or, like, sound isn't good either in

309
0:16:15.680 --> 0:16:18.200
the tutorial, but it gets you started.

310
0:16:18.200 --> 0:16:19.200
Yeah.

311
0:16:19.200 --> 0:16:20.200
Simpler systems are good.

312
0:16:20.200 --> 0:16:24.900
I especially love having, like, a place to go on from.

313
0:16:24.900 --> 0:16:29.680
So again, referring to that video above, I put, like, the whole resource pack I found

314
0:16:29.680 --> 0:16:34.080
in the world, which has all sorts of resources, including, like, crystals and stuff like that.

315
0:16:34.080 --> 0:16:38.120
And I show very clearly during the tutorial, here's where you make an ore more difficult

316
0:16:38.120 --> 0:16:40.280
to mine or require more hits.

317
0:16:40.280 --> 0:16:43.120
And so you could go into that world, and if you wanted to learn a little bit more, you

318
0:16:43.120 --> 0:16:48.760
could set it up such that the crystal resources required more mining or maybe a different

319
0:16:48.760 --> 0:16:49.760
pickaxe.

320
0:16:49.760 --> 0:16:50.760
But it is the...

321
0:16:50.760 --> 0:16:55.280
There have been other examples, but it's one of, like, you know, the sort of initial examples

322
0:16:55.280 --> 0:17:00.880
of where I take, like, 500 other videos I've recorded and smush them together into a new

323
0:17:00.880 --> 0:17:01.880
tutorial.

324
0:17:01.880 --> 0:17:05.120
Sometimes I do, like, isolated technical concepts, and it's like, well, why would I need this

325
0:17:05.120 --> 0:17:06.120
node?

326
0:17:06.120 --> 0:17:07.120
Well, here's a video for you.

327
0:17:07.120 --> 0:17:08.120
It's called Mineable.

328
0:17:08.120 --> 0:17:12.920
Yeah, I don't want to make big claims here, because it's hard to prove, but I think I

329
0:17:12.920 --> 0:17:16.700
was the first person to do a health system.

330
0:17:16.700 --> 0:17:21.880
If you look up the world browser for deathmatch template, there is an ancient world.

331
0:17:21.880 --> 0:17:23.960
It was a long, long, long time ago.

332
0:17:23.960 --> 0:17:29.320
In fact, the only person I recognized that was around back then in this chat right now

333
0:17:29.320 --> 0:17:30.320
was business lawyer.

334
0:17:30.320 --> 0:17:33.400
But business lawyer has been here forever.

335
0:17:33.400 --> 0:17:35.440
And that was the first time I saw it.

336
0:17:35.440 --> 0:17:36.440
I had guns.

337
0:17:36.440 --> 0:17:37.960
I had HP points.

338
0:17:37.960 --> 0:17:38.960
I had respawning.

339
0:17:38.960 --> 0:17:40.560
I had it all down.

340
0:17:40.560 --> 0:17:44.660
The reason behind that sort of rush was that I don't think anyone understood dynamic impulses

341
0:17:44.660 --> 0:17:45.840
back then.

342
0:17:45.840 --> 0:17:51.320
But Fruch kept going around in various worlds, and they were, like, showing off dynamic impulses,

343
0:17:51.320 --> 0:17:54.080
and people were like, oh, those are cool.

344
0:17:54.080 --> 0:17:58.360
And then he started seeing stuff being created using dynamic impulses, and he's like, yay,

345
0:17:58.360 --> 0:17:59.360
the knowledge is spreading.

346
0:17:59.360 --> 0:18:01.700
I don't know if he just added dynamic impulses.

347
0:18:01.700 --> 0:18:02.700
It might have been that.

348
0:18:02.700 --> 0:18:04.000
I don't know if you can look at the update notes.

349
0:18:04.000 --> 0:18:05.400
But yeah, look at deathmatch template.

350
0:18:05.400 --> 0:18:06.400
It is ancient.

351
0:18:06.400 --> 0:18:11.120
I was going to do a tutorial on how that worked, but of course then it changed because of dynamic

352
0:18:11.120 --> 0:18:12.120
variables.

353
0:18:12.120 --> 0:18:13.120
Yeah.

354
0:18:13.120 --> 0:18:14.120
Deathmatch template.

355
0:18:14.120 --> 0:18:15.120
12th of April, 2019.

356
0:18:15.120 --> 0:18:16.520
Long, long, long time ago.

357
0:18:16.520 --> 0:18:21.120
So Kip says if a mesh has the same vertex groups, can you swap it out by changing the

358
0:18:21.120 --> 0:18:22.120
reference?

359
0:18:22.120 --> 0:18:23.120
Yes.

360
0:18:23.120 --> 0:18:24.120
Yes, I think so.

361
0:18:24.120 --> 0:18:25.120
Try it.

362
0:18:25.120 --> 0:18:26.120
Here's the best bet as well.

363
0:18:26.120 --> 0:18:30.120
If you save the avatar and you have edits that you want to apply anyway and you're worried

364
0:18:30.120 --> 0:18:33.240
about reimporting the avatar, it's worth it to try.

365
0:18:33.240 --> 0:18:36.520
Just go in a world, slap down the saved avatar, update that mesh.

366
0:18:36.520 --> 0:18:41.320
If it turns into a cosmic horror being, then you're out of luck.

367
0:18:41.320 --> 0:18:42.720
Sometimes it will just work.

368
0:18:42.720 --> 0:18:45.000
There is also the rig transfer tool tip.

369
0:18:45.000 --> 0:18:47.080
I have no idea how that's meant to work.

370
0:18:47.080 --> 0:18:49.300
I've been meaning to ask for years.

371
0:18:49.300 --> 0:18:55.160
Because the avatar rig transfer tool tip either does cosmic horror or works flawlessly, and

372
0:18:55.160 --> 0:18:58.320
I don't understand why or when.

373
0:18:58.320 --> 0:19:01.880
Specs says, yes, I think the key to having either of those work is has the vertex sort

374
0:19:01.880 --> 0:19:02.880
of changed.

375
0:19:02.880 --> 0:19:03.880
Or something like that.

376
0:19:03.880 --> 0:19:05.800
It's like, has the vertex order changed?

377
0:19:05.800 --> 0:19:07.200
Has the number of bones changed?

378
0:19:07.200 --> 0:19:08.840
Has the number of shape keys changed?

379
0:19:08.840 --> 0:19:13.560
A fun story here which leads to a bunch of crazy cosmic horror is if you rig transfer

380
0:19:13.560 --> 0:19:16.840
tool tip to stuff you know isn't going to be incompatible, sometimes it can lead to

381
0:19:16.840 --> 0:19:18.080
cool results.

382
0:19:18.080 --> 0:19:24.560
I have a version of my regular tutorial avatar which I accidentally rig transferred with

383
0:19:24.560 --> 0:19:26.760
a Dutch angel dragon.

384
0:19:26.760 --> 0:19:32.360
And it turned me into this very spindly creature that has a Dutch angel dragon head that's

385
0:19:32.360 --> 0:19:36.640
all shriveled and a tiny wing on one side.

386
0:19:36.640 --> 0:19:40.120
It looks really cosmic horror-y, but kind of artistic as well.

387
0:19:40.120 --> 0:19:42.120
So try that out.

388
0:19:42.120 --> 0:19:48.520
Maybe take a Hobkin and rig transfer it onto a Rex and see what monstrosity you create.

389
0:19:48.520 --> 0:19:51.480
Kip says, do you have a tutorial on camera objects and outputting it to a texture real

390
0:19:51.480 --> 0:19:52.480
time?

391
0:19:52.480 --> 0:19:53.480
Possibly.

392
0:19:53.480 --> 0:19:56.680
Give me a second.

393
0:19:56.680 --> 0:19:57.680
Not directly.

394
0:19:57.680 --> 0:20:02.960
The following video on a showcase of building a key to him might help.

395
0:20:02.960 --> 0:20:05.720
Because that uses a camera texture.

396
0:20:05.720 --> 0:20:11.400
The builder key to is a very simple in terms of textured model.

397
0:20:11.400 --> 0:20:15.920
By his name, he periodically jumps in and says hi.

398
0:20:15.920 --> 0:20:23.280
And the text sheet basically has squares of color for each part of the key to.

399
0:20:23.280 --> 0:20:24.280
Except for the body.

400
0:20:24.280 --> 0:20:26.200
The body is more complicated so you can do patterns and stuff like that.

401
0:20:26.200 --> 0:20:29.720
But things like the collar, the tie, the eyes, the nose, et cetera, those are all sort of

402
0:20:29.720 --> 0:20:31.520
just single squares.

403
0:20:31.520 --> 0:20:38.240
And so you can change the color of those by just what I do is I put a quad over that area

404
0:20:38.240 --> 0:20:39.740
on the texture sheet.

405
0:20:39.740 --> 0:20:44.920
And then I have a camera in front of that, which I then hook up to the actual texture

406
0:20:44.920 --> 0:20:45.920
of the Akita.

407
0:20:45.920 --> 0:20:47.820
And that way you can see the changes live.

408
0:20:47.820 --> 0:20:52.920
And then when you hit bake, I bake that camera view into an actual texture.

409
0:20:52.920 --> 0:20:57.120
And I set that texture to be the texture of the avatar.

410
0:20:57.120 --> 0:20:58.800
Similar way to how neoto shop works.

411
0:20:58.800 --> 0:21:02.520
It's inspired by how neoto shop works.

412
0:21:02.520 --> 0:21:05.800
And leads to a lot of cool stuff going on there.

413
0:21:05.800 --> 0:21:08.880
You can kind of see how composition works in this random screenshot.

414
0:21:08.880 --> 0:21:12.840
I'm going to pull out of the middle of nowhere.

415
0:21:12.840 --> 0:21:19.620
Here where we have this is a science application I was doing the other day.

416
0:21:19.620 --> 0:21:25.660
In this picture, you can see that we've got two cameras being composited by having a third

417
0:21:25.660 --> 0:21:27.080
camera in front of them.

418
0:21:27.080 --> 0:21:30.480
So two cameras output their two views to a quad.

419
0:21:30.480 --> 0:21:35.040
And then in front of that is another camera which composites them together with some UIX,

420
0:21:35.040 --> 0:21:36.600
which is graphing data.

421
0:21:36.600 --> 0:21:40.520
And then you could make that a texture for an avatar if you wanted to.

422
0:21:40.520 --> 0:21:44.880
For another example of seeing that in place, at the top of my head, my MMC 2022 entry does

423
0:21:44.880 --> 0:21:46.800
have that in there for the whirlpools.

424
0:21:46.800 --> 0:21:49.640
I don't remember where they are, how to get to them.

425
0:21:49.640 --> 0:21:53.520
That world was created quite rapidly as I gave myself a weekend to do it.

426
0:21:53.520 --> 0:21:55.040
So take a look.

427
0:21:55.040 --> 0:21:57.120
With that, I believe we're out of questions and out of time.

428
0:21:57.120 --> 0:21:59.080
So I'm going to go ahead and leave things off here.

429
0:21:59.080 --> 0:22:00.360
And I will see you again next week.

430
0:22:00.360 --> 0:22:04.320
If you have any questions in the meantime, please feel free to direct message me, post

431
0:22:04.320 --> 0:22:09.080
on the Discord, make bug reports, et cetera.

432
0:22:09.080 --> 0:22:11.500
And I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

433
0:22:11.500 --> 0:22:14.800
Watch that mineable ore video if you're interested in making a mining system and keep your requests

434
0:22:14.800 --> 0:22:16.200
coming in for what you'd like to see next.

435
0:22:16.200 --> 0:22:17.200
I saw health system.

436
0:22:17.200 --> 0:22:18.840
I'll add that to my list to do.

437
0:22:18.840 --> 0:22:19.840
Oh, your previous question.

438
0:22:19.840 --> 0:22:21.400
If I missed the question, I'm going to go back to it.

439
0:22:21.400 --> 0:22:22.400
I'm sorry, Lex.

440
0:22:22.400 --> 0:22:23.400
I'm sorry.

441
0:22:23.400 --> 0:22:24.400
That wasn't a question.

442
0:22:24.400 --> 0:22:26.960
Do you mean the anim.j one?

443
0:22:26.960 --> 0:22:27.960
I haven't looked yet.

444
0:22:27.960 --> 0:22:28.960
I promise you.

445
0:22:28.960 --> 0:22:29.960
I haven't looked yet.

446
0:22:29.960 --> 0:22:30.960
I do mean to look.

447
0:22:30.960 --> 0:22:31.960
It's just I haven't looked yet.

448
0:22:31.960 --> 0:22:33.360
My list is quite big.

449
0:22:33.360 --> 0:22:35.680
I will communicate when I take a look.

450
0:22:35.680 --> 0:22:36.680
All right.

451
0:22:36.680 --> 0:22:37.680
Speak to you later.

452
0:22:37.680 --> 0:22:52.860
All right.
